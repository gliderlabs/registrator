# Run Reference

Registrator is designed to be run once on every host. You *could* run a single
Registrator for your cluster, but you get better scaling properties and easier
configuration by ensuring Registrator runs on every host. Assuming some level of
automation, running everywhere is ironically simpler than running once somewhere.

## Running Registrator

    docker run [docker options] gliderlabs/registrator[:tag] [options] <registry uri>

Registrator requires and recommends some Docker options, has its own set of options
and then requires a Registry URI. Here is a typical way to run Registrator:

    $ docker run -d \
        --name=registrator \
        --net=host \
        --volume=/var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock \
        gliderlabs/registrator:latest \
          consul://localhost:8500

## Docker Options

Option                                           | Required    | Description
------                                           | --------    | -----------
`--volume=/var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock` | yes         | Allows Registrator to access Docker API
`--net=host`                                     | recommended | Helps Registrator get host-level IP and hostname

An alternative to host network mode would be to set the container hostname to the host
hostname (`-h $HOSTNAME`) and using the `-ip` Registrator option below.

## Registrator Options

Option                   | Description
------                   | -----------
`-internal`              | Use exposed ports instead of published ports
`-ip <ip address>`       | Force IP address used for registering services
`-retry-attempts`        | Max retry attempts to establish a connection with the backend
`-retry-interval`        | Interval (in millisecond) between retry-attempts
`-tags <tags>`           | Force comma-separated tags on all registered services
`-deregister <mode>`     | Deregister existed services "always" or "on-success". Default: always
`-ttl <seconds>`         | TTL for services. Default: 0, no expiry (supported backends only)
`-ttl-refresh <seconds>` | Frequency service TTLs are refreshed (supported backends only)
`-resync <seconds>`      | Frequency all services are resynchronized. Default: 0, never

If the `-internal` option is used, Registrator will register the docker0
internal IP and port instead of the host mapped ones. This behavior can
be selectively enabled or disabled for individual containers by including
`registrator:internal=<true/false>` in the container environment.

By default, when registering a service, Registrator will assign the service
address by attempting to resolve the current hostname. If you would like to
force the service address to be a specific address, you can specify the `-ip`
argument. The IP can be set selectively per container by including
`registrator:ip=<ip address>` in the container environment.

For registry backends that support TTL expiry, Registrator can both set and
refresh service TTLs with `-ttl` and `-ttl-refresh`.

If you want unlimited retry-attempts use `-retry-attempts -1`.

The `-resync` options controls how often Registrator will query Docker for all
containers and reregister all services.  This allows Registrator and the service
registry to get back in sync if they fall out of sync.

## Registry URI

    <backend>://<address>[/<path>]

The registry backend to use is defined by a URI. The scheme is the supported
registry name. The address is a host or host and port used to connect to the
registry. Some registries support a path definition used, for example, as the prefix to use
in service definitions for key-value based registries.

For full reference of supported backends, see [Registry Backends](backends.md).
